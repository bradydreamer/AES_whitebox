To test the attack, you just have to:

 1 - create the file tables.h with a key of your choice, for example: 
   ../../whitebox_aes_generator/generate_tables -z keys/key1

   (-z for zero protection)

 2 - make the attack executable
   make clean; make 

 3 - lanch the attack
   ./attack

 warning: if mixing bijections or encodings are activated, 
 	  the attack will still give a key but obviously a wrong one;
	  don't forget the -z option!
