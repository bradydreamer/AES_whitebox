To test the attack, you just have to:

 1 - create tables.h with a key of your choice, for example: 
   ../../whitebox_aes_generator/generate_tables -e keys/key1

   (-e option activates encodings only)

 2 - make the attack executable 
   make clean; make 

 3 - do the attack 
   ./attack

 REMARK: if mixing bijections are activated, the attack won't work.
 	 Don't forget the -e option!
